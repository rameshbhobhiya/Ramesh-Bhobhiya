# Here is what I'm  learning @ IIT Ropar


## I'm currently learning Financial Mathematics (Financial Derivatives)
## I'm currently learning Measure theory  (Having huge application in Probability and stochastic processes)
## I'm currently learning Non-linear Daynamics 
(After the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, interest in nonlinear dynamics, especially deterministic chaotic dynamics, has increased in both the financial press and the academic literature. This has come about because the frequency of large moves in stock markets is greater than would be expected under a normal distribution. There are a number of possible explanations. A popular one is that the stock market is governed by chaotic dynamics.)
## I'm currently learning Theory Of Computation 



# Here are the key subjects I have done !
## I have learnt Probability and Stochastic Processes 
## I have learnt Foundation Of Data Science
## C++ , Matlab,Latex,Python
## I have learnt Numerical Analysis with matlab ( This subject have great use to get  analytical solution of complex problems )
